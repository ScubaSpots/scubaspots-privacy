## What Data Will Be Deleted?

When your account is deleted, the following information will be permanently removed from our systems:

- Your ScubaSpots account  
- Your profile information (name, profile picture, bio)  
- Your email address  
- Any personal details linked to your identity  
- Saved locations or personal preferences

## What Data Will Be Retained

To preserve the quality and completeness of the community database, the following **public contributions** will remain visible in the app **after your account is deleted**:

- Photos you uploaded  
- Reviews and ratings you submitted  

However:

- Your username will no longer be shown  
- Your email address will not be visible  
- Your profile will no longer be linked to this content  

Your contributions will appear as coming from a generic **“Deleted user”** (or equivalent), so they can no longer be associated with your identity.

This approach allows us to protect your personal data while still preserving community content that other users rely on.

## Temporary Data Retention

For security, fraud prevention and audit requirements, we may retain system-level logs for up to **30 days** after your deletion request.

These logs are used only for operational and security purposes and **cannot be used to personally identify you**.

---

## Processing Time

Account deletion requests are typically processed within:

🕒 **3–7 business days**

You will receive a confirmation email once the deletion is complete.
